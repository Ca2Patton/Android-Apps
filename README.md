# Android-Apps
Learning how to make android applications. Ideally, will wind up with a raid planner.

Raid Planner Goals:
  Create activity calender that syncs across time zones to let clanmates know of upcoming activities.
  RSVPing for raid activities (Vault of Glass, Crota's End, King's Fall)
  RSVPing for crucible activities (Iron Banner, Trials of Osiris)
  
Side ideas:
  Chat room for clanmates who just want to bug each other, instead of spamming the activity chat in PSN. (Your spam filter, IceHawk, Pbo. It's all your getting.)
  Support for other games?
